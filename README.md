# Riyaz - Palta/Alankar

A web-based tool for Indian classical music practice. Enter the first line of a palta (alankar) and the app generates all ascending and descending lines automatically, with playback using synthesized Piano or Harmonium sounds. Includes a tanpura drone for practice and a MIDI keyboard interface for playing along.

**Live app:** https://muneerahmed94-alt.github.io/riyaz-palta-alankar/

Developed by Muneer Ahmed Shaik.

## Features

### Tanpura Drone
- Synthesized tanpura drone with a physically-inspired 16-partial harmonic stack and jawari bridge simulation. Perceptually-tuned sweet-band emphasis at partials 3/5/7, slow per-partial tremolo (for shimmer), slow jawari bloom on the upper partials (so they swell in over 2–5 seconds rather than appearing immediately), and a steady-state rendered loop with an equal-power crossfaded boundary so the drone is continuous and click-free.
- **Strings**: Pa Sa Sa Sa (default), Ma Sa Sa Sa, Ni Sa Sa Sa, plus 5-string variants
- **Pitch register**: Male (lower octave) / Female (higher octave)
- **Volume**: adjustable slider (0–100)
- **Tempo**: pluck cycle speed (30–120 BPM)
- **Jawari**: controls the characteristic buzzing overtone richness (0–100). The jawari bridge causes upper harmonics to swell after the pluck rather than decaying, creating the shimmering drone effect
- Uses the selected root key (Sa =) for pitch
- Runs independently of palta playback — practice with drone accompaniment
- Auto-restarts when tuning or pitch register changes

### Swara Selector (Chromatic Piano Keyboard UI)
- Full chromatic 12-key piano layout (7 white + 5 black) at the top of the input card
- **Western note labels are always fixed** (C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B)
- **Swara labels move** based on the selected root key (Sa =). When Sa = C, "Sa" is on the C key; when Sa = D, "Sa" moves to the D key, etc.
- Click any non-fixed key to toggle between Shuddh and Komal/Teevra variants
- Sa and Pa are fixed (no variants in Indian classical music)
- Selection dynamically updates frequency mapping (`SWARA_SEMITONES[]`) and display names
- When a palta is displayed, changing a swara variant instantly re-renders with updated pitches and notation

### Display Notation Convention (Pt Ramanuj Dasgupta style)
The app follows the standard Indian classical notation convention:
- **Shuddh swaras**: uppercase — S R G P D N
- **Shuddh Ma**: lowercase **m** (because Teevra Ma takes the uppercase)
- **Komal swaras**: lowercase — r g d n
- **Teevra Ma**: uppercase **M**
- Example: `SRGmPDNS` = all Shuddh; `SRGMPDNS` = with Teevra Ma
- On "Generate", the input text field auto-corrects to match the selected swara variants (e.g., typing `SRG` with Komal Ga selected becomes `S R g`)
- All preset button labels (common, special, my patterns) dynamically update when swara variants are toggled on the piano selector

### Pattern Presets
Three categories of preset patterns:

**Common patterns** — 12 palta starting sequences, organized by complexity:
- Repetitions: Sa Sa, Sa Sa Sa, Sa Sa Sa Sa
- Ascending pairs/groups: Sa Re, Sa Ga, Sa Re Ga, Sa Re Ga ma, Sa Re Ga ma Pa, Sa Re Ga ma Pa Dha
- With direction changes: Sa Re Sa, Sa Re Ga Re Sa, Sa Re Ga Sa Re

**Special patterns** — Four types that don't use standard transposition:
- Sa Re Ga ma Pa Dha Ni Sa' (scale) — full ascending scale with avarohi support
- Sa Re, Sa Ga, Sa ma, ... Sa Sa' (Sa paired with each ascending swara)
- Re Sa, Ga Sa, ma Sa, ... Sa' Sa (each swara paired back to Sa)
- Sa, Sa Pa, Sa ma Pa (expanding) — each line adds one more swara. With "Include Avarohi" checked, each line mirrors ascending + descending with the top note doubled: S → S P P S → S m P P m S → ... → S R G m P D N S' S' N D P m G R S. Unchecked: ascending only (S, S P, S m P, ...).
- Default tempo: 60 BPM for sa-x/x-sa/expanding, 102 BPM for scale

**My patterns** — Custom saved patterns:
- Sa Ga Sa Re (6 lines), Sa Re Ga ma Sa Ga Re ma, Sa Re Re Sa Re Ga Re Sa (7 lines), Sa .Ni Re .Ni Re Ga ma Ga (7 lines), Sa Pa ma Ga Re Sa Re Ga (6 lines)

### Palta Generation
- Enter swaras in any format: full names (`Sa Re Ga Ma`), short (`S R G M`), or continuous (`SRGM`)
- Supports three octaves: lower (`.Sa`), middle (`Sa`), upper (`Sa'`)
- Octave markers work as prefix or suffix: `.N`, `N.`, `'S`, `S'` all valid
- **Nearest-octave auto-resolution**: When no octave marker is given, each note after the first is placed in the octave nearest to the previous note (e.g., `SNSN` becomes `S .N S .N` — N below Sa, not 6 steps above). The **Select nearest note** checkbox (checked by default) enables this behaviour; uncheck it before clicking Generate to keep all unmarked notes in the middle octave exactly as typed. The checkbox is hidden when a preset is clicked and reappears when the user edits the text field manually. Presets always parse without nearest-octave regardless of the checkbox
- When the Swara Selector piano variant changes (e.g. `m` → `M`), the sequence input text is updated to reflect the new display name without re-resolving octave placement
- Continuous strings support embedded octave markers: `S.NS.NSRGM` parses correctly
- **Lines stepper** (− / number / +) sits below the Generate button and shows the suggested line count based on the current input. Updates live as you type or toggle the "Select nearest note" checkbox. You can adjust it freely before clicking Generate. For presets, the formula (or `data-lines` pin) writes the suggested value into the stepper. For custom input, Generate reads the stepper value directly
- **Line count formula**: `lineCount = clamp(1, 7, 8 - maxOffset + max(0, -minOffset))`, where `maxOffset` is the highest note in the pattern relative to the first and `minOffset` is the lowest. Using `maxOffset` keeps non-monotonic/descending patterns from producing unrealistic counts. Examples: SR = 7, SRGm = 5, SGSR = 7, S.NR.NRGmG = 7 (dip adds 1), SPmGRSRG = 6 (pinned via `data-lines`)
- **Include Avarohi** checkbox in output card — live toggle to show/hide descending section
- Add or remove lines with +/- buttons on the last line after generation
- Copy generated palta as plain text

### Sound Engine (Web Audio API, no samples)
- **Grand Piano** — Additive synthesis with 10 harmonics, inharmonicity modeling, hammer noise burst, soundboard resonance
- **Upright Piano** — Shorter decay, mid-frequency EQ boost for "boxy" character
- **Electric Piano** — FM synthesis (Rhodes-style) with tremolo LFO
- **Harmonium** — Source-filter synthesis modeled after Puranik & Scavone's DAFx 2023 paper *"Physically Inspired Signal Model for Harmonium Sound Synthesis"*. The insight: a real harmonium's recognizable voice is the product of a rich reed signal passed through a complex wooden-cabinet formant filter. Changing brand = changing that filter.
  - **Reed source** — `PeriodicWave` built from a 32-partial LTAS (long-term average spectrum) measured from Indian hand harmoniums: strong f0 and 2f, notch at the 4th partial, plateau through partials 5–12, gentle rolloff to ~25. Much richer than a small additive sine stack.
  - **Cabinet filter** — Cascade of 5 peaking biquads + high-shelf + lowpass, with per-brand parameter presets:
    - **Paul & Co** — warm, pronounced 1.6 kHz nasal bark, rolled-off highs (the "Rolls-Royce" classical-vocal sound)
    - **Pakrashi** — brighter, 2.4 kHz projection peak, more open upper register
    - **DSR** — balanced, slightly scooped low-mids, clear upper
    - **MKS** — tightest low end, punchy 1.2 kHz bite, extended top (modern scale changers)
  - **Exponential ~40 ms attack** matching real free-reed self-excitation spin-up
  - **Chiff** — soft filtered-noise burst on onset for the air-rush transient
  - **Bellows LFO (~3 Hz)** — shallow amplitude + ±1.5-cent pitch wobble, with per-note phase offset so sustained notes don't beat in sync
  - **Per-reed detuning + drift** (±6–8 cents between reed pairs, ±2 cents micro-drift) for natural chorus beating
  - **Small-room convolution reverb** — a synthetic ~1.8 s stereo IR (6 early reflections for floor/walls/ceiling + an exponentially-decaying low-pass-filtered noise tail) processed by a `ConvolverNode`. Notes are split into ~82% dry / 18% wet through a shared bus so the reverb tail rings between successive notes, giving the instrument a natural sense of space
  - 6 reed configurations: Bass-Male, Bass-Male-Female, Bass-Male-Male, Male-Male-Female-Bass, Bass-Male-Female-Female, Bass-Bass-Male-Female
- Sound options are located in the Output Card (after "Generated Palta" header)

### Playback
- Adjustable tempo (60–480 BPM, default 102 for regular, 60 for special patterns)
- Beat counter (2, 3, 4, 6, 8) with optional skip
- Play aarohi only, avarohi only, or both
- Repeat mode for continuous practice
- Visual note highlighting during playback
- Left coupler (adds lower octave) for both Piano and Harmonium
- Selectable root key (Sa = C through B)

### MIDI Keyboard
- Connect any MIDI keyboard via Web MIDI API
- Same sound engine as palta playback (Piano / Harmonium with all options)
- Velocity sensitivity
- Sustain pedal support (MIDI CC 64)
- Sustain checkbox (Piano only) — notes ring out naturally without damping
- Coupler: None / Left / Right
- Octave shift: ±3 octaves
- Transpose: ±12 semitones
- Register-dependent sustain (bass notes ring longer than treble)
- Register-dependent damper release time
- Auto-detects MIDI devices with hot-plug support

### Mobile Background Playback (iOS / Android)
Designed for practising while driving with the phone locked. iOS throttles Web Audio in backgrounded tabs — even routing through a MediaStream bridge slows down and stutters. The only approach that plays full-speed in background is to hand a self-contained media file to the platform's native audio pipeline. So both palta and tanpura work the same way:

1. **Render offline.** `OfflineAudioContext` runs the same synthesis functions used for live playback and produces an `AudioBuffer` of one full iteration (palta) or one full string cycle (tanpura).
2. **Encode to WAV.** `audioBufferToWavBlob()` writes the buffer as a 16-bit PCM WAV `Blob` in memory (no network, no build step).
3. **Play through an `<audio>` element.** `URL.createObjectURL(blob)` → `audio.src` → `audio.play()`, with `loop = true` for tanpura and for palta Repeat mode.

Native `<audio>` playback uses iOS's AudioToolbox / AVFoundation, which keeps running when the tab backgrounds, the phone locks, or the screen sleeps.

Other bits:

- **Gesture priming** — a 10 ms silent WAV is loaded into the `<audio>` element *inside the click handler* before the async render begins. That claim to an active user gesture lets the subsequent blob swap-and-play go through iOS autoplay policy when the render finishes ~200 ms later.
- **Media Session API** — the lock screen shows "Tanpura Drone" or "Palta Playback". The lock-screen pause button is wired to the app's stop action.
- **Auto-resume on return** — `visibilitychange` / `pageshow` / `focus` handlers restart any paused `<audio>` element and `resume()` any suspended `AudioContext`.

Caveats:
- Changing tempo / tuning / pitch / jawari / skip toggles mid-playback doesn't take effect on the running loop — the WAV is baked. Press Stop then Play again to apply.
- Volume slider applies live to the tanpura `<audio>` element's `.volume` (no re-render).
- There's a small startup delay (typically under 500 ms) while the offline render completes. In practice that's smaller than clicking Stop and Play took on the previous live-scheduling version.

  README.md     — This file
```

## Architecture

The app is a single `index.html` file with no external dependencies (except Google Fonts). Everything runs client-side in the browser.

### CSS (inline `<style>`)
Organized into 6 sections:
1. **Base / Layout** — body, container, header, cards; vintage parchment palette (Lora serif headings, warm ochre/saffron tones)
2. **Input Card** — form elements, preset chip buttons, generate row, lines stepper, nearest-note checkbox; sub-sections: Tanpura Controls (drone, sample/synth modes, sliders) and Swara Selector (chromatic piano keyboard, white/black keys, swara labels)
3. **Output Card** — palta line display, sound options, playback bar, include avarohi, volume mixer, legend
4. **Playback Controls** — listen/practice/stop buttons, tempo, beat selector, autoscroll checkbox (`.autoscroll-cb`), blue highlight override for practice silent phase
5. **MIDI Card + Footer** — MIDI connection UI, sound options, octave/transpose buttons; footer colophon styles
6. **Responsive** — mobile breakpoint ≤ 600px (optimized for iPhone 14 at 390px)

### JavaScript (inline `<script>`)
Seven subsystems + event listeners:

#### 1. Swara Parser
Converts user input text into numeric note values (0–20 across three octaves). Handles full names, short names, continuous strings, and octave markers.

**Key features:**
- `parseSwara()` — Parses a single token. Returns `{ value, isShort, explicitOctave }`. The `explicitOctave` flag tracks whether the user provided `.` or `'` markers. Supports markers as prefix OR suffix.
- `trySplitContinuous()` — Tokenizes continuous strings like `S.NS.NSRGM` into individual swara tokens with attached octave markers.
- `nearestOctave()` — For notes without explicit octave markers, finds the octave placement (lower/middle/upper) that is closest to the previous note.
- `parseSequence(input, useNearestOctave)` — Two-phase parsing: (1) tokenize all swaras, (2) apply nearest-octave resolution for unmarked notes when `useNearestOctave=true` (default); pass `false` to keep all unmarked notes in their default middle-octave placement. The flag is wired to the **Select nearest note** checkbox in the UI. First note always defaults to middle octave if unmarked regardless of the flag.

**Display name system:**
- `SWARAS_FULL` / `SWARAS_SHORT` — Immutable constants for input parsing (case-insensitive).
- `SWARAS_FULL_DISPLAY` / `SWARAS_SHORT_DISPLAY` — Mutable arrays for output rendering. Updated by `updateSwaraDisplayName()` when swara variants change on the piano selector.
- `numToSwara()` — Reads from the `_DISPLAY` arrays, so rendered output always reflects the current Komal/Teevra selections.

#### 2. Palta Generator
Two generators:

**Standard** (`generatePalta()`) — Takes parsed notes and generates all ascending/descending lines by computing interval offsets from the first note and transposing up/down one step at a time.

**Special** (`generateSpecialPalta()`) — For SR/SG/.../SS' and RS/GS/.../S'S patterns. Each line pairs a fixed base note (Sa) with a different scale degree, walking up for aarohi and back down for avarohi.

Both generators produce the same `{ ascending, descending, landingTop, landingBottom }` structure, so rendering, playback, and copy work identically.

#### 3. Renderer
Builds DOM elements for each palta line. Each swara `<span>` gets `data-section`, `data-line`, `data-swar` attributes used by the playback engine for visual highlighting.

#### 4. Audio Engine
All synthesis uses the Web Audio API (no audio samples).

**Frequency mapping:**
- `SWARA_SEMITONES[]` — **Mutable** array mapping swara index (0–6) to semitone offset from Sa. Updated by the Swara Selector when Komal/Teevra variants are toggled.
- `SWARA_VARIANTS[]` — Configuration defining Shuddh and variant semitone values for each swara. Sa (index 0) and Pa (index 4) are `null` (fixed, no variants).
- `noteNumToFreq()` — Reads `SWARA_SEMITONES[swaraIdx]` to compute Hz. Automatically reflects current variant selections.

**Synthesis:**
- **Piano inharmonicity**: Partials are stretched using `freq * n * sqrt(1 + B*n²)` where B increases with pitch, modeling real piano string physics.
- **Harmonium reeds**: Source-filter model. Each reed is a `PeriodicWave` built from a 32-partial LTAS. All reeds mix into a per-brand cabinet filter (5 peaking biquads + high-shelf + lowpass) modeling the wooden enclosure, then the whole harmonium bus feeds a shared synthetic small-room convolution reverb. See `getHarmoniumReedWave()`, `HARMONIUM_BRANDS`, `buildHarmoniumCabinet()`, and `getHarmoniumReverbBus()`.
- **Metronome**: Two sine oscillators (880 Hz + 1760 Hz) with instant attack and fast decay for a wood-block click sound.

**Mobile background playback (offline render → WAV → `<audio>`):**
- `renderToBuffer(sampleRate, duration, channels, renderFn)` — runs an `OfflineAudioContext` render and returns the resulting `AudioBuffer`.
- `audioBufferToWavBlob(buffer)` — encodes an `AudioBuffer` as a 16-bit PCM WAV `Blob` (44-byte RIFF header + interleaved int16 samples).
- `ensureMediaPlayer(name)` / `loadAndPlayBlob(name, blob)` / `stopMediaPlayer(name)` — manages a pool of hidden `<audio>` elements (one named per concurrent source: `'palta'`, `'tanpura'`). Swaps the blob URL and plays. Tracks the old URL and revokes it on swap or stop.
- `makeSilencePrimer()` — returns a 10 ms silent WAV Blob used to prime the `<audio>` element inside a user-gesture click handler.
- `setMediaSessionMetadata()` / `setMediaSessionHandlers()` — Media Session API integration for the lock screen.
- `trackAudioContext()` — registers a context so `visibilitychange` / `pageshow` / `focus` listeners can call `resume()` on it.

#### 5. Playback Engine
Palta playback uses the offline-render + `<audio>`-element pattern so it keeps playing full-speed when the tab is backgrounded on iOS:

- `startPlayback(mode, triggerBtn)` — builds the full timeline (aarohi + avarohi for `'all'`, or just one section for `'asc'` / `'desc'`), renders it via `renderPaltaWav()`, encodes to a WAV blob, and plays through the `'palta'` `<audio>` element. Primes the element with a silent blob inside the click handler so iOS permits the swap-to-real-blob after the render.
- `renderPaltaWav(sampleRate, timeline, ip, renderSec)` — runs `renderToBuffer()` with `renderPaltaTimelineOnContext()` as the render function, then encodes via `audioBufferToWavBlob()`.
- `renderPaltaTimelineOnContext(ctx, dest, timeline, ip)` — schedules all notes of one timeline onto a context (live or offline). Shared between offline render (used now) and the code path that would live-schedule if we ever needed to fall back.
- Repeat mode sets `audio.loop = true`; otherwise we listen for the `ended` event and call `finishPlayback()`.
- Visual highlights are driven by `requestAnimationFrame` via `startHighlightLoop()` with two strategies: **repeat mode** uses `audio.currentTime % iterationSec` (self-correcting — no drift accumulates across iterations); **single-shot** uses a wall-clock timer anchored to the `'playing'` event (avoids iOS Safari reporting `currentTime` ahead of actual speaker output on large single-shot WAVs). `iterationSec` is computed from the exact WAV sample count (`shaped.length / sampleRate`) so the modulo boundary aligns perfectly with the loop point.

**Key functions:**
- `doGenerate()` — Reads the **Select nearest note** checkbox, parses input (passing the flag to `parseSequence`), generates palta, renders, sets tempo to 102 BPM. Auto-corrects input text to reflect swara variants.
- `doGenerateSpecial(type)` — Generates special patterns (sa-x or x-sa), sets tempo to 60 BPM.
- `reRenderPalta()` — Re-generates and re-renders the current palta (handles both standard and special via `currentSpecialType` flag). Called when swara variants, include avarohi, or line counts change.
- `updateSwaraDisplayName()` — Updates display name arrays when a variant is toggled. Handles the special Ma convention (Shuddh=lowercase, Teevra=uppercase).
- `updatePresetLabels()` — Re-renders all preset button labels (common, special, my patterns) and the pattern-info text using the current display name arrays. Called when swara variants change.
- `setTempo(bpm)` — Sets both the slider and input to the given BPM value.

#### 6. Tanpura Engine
Synthesizes a tanpura drone with additive sine harmonics whose amplitude
envelopes are shaped to match the acoustic features of a real tanpura:

**Per-pluck synthesis (`pluckTanpuraString`):**
- 16 sine partials at `freq × n × sqrt(1 + 0.00008 n²)` (slight stretched inharmonicity) with ±3 cents random detune per partial so the stack feels alive.
- **Harmonic profile** tuned by ear toward real tanpura recordings — not a descending 1/n rolloff. The "sweet band" at partials 3, 5, 7 is emphasised (these are the 5th, 10th, and 14th above the fundamental — the strongest perceptual overtones of a tanpura); the octave (partial 2) is held back so it doesn't dominate.
- **Envelope by partial group**:
  - Fundamental (n=1): sharp 30 ms attack, falls to 55% within 0.3 s, long smooth decay over 9 s.
  - Octave (n=2): gentler 80 ms attack, supports the fundamental at 60% sustain.
  - Partials 3–16: **jawari bloom** — each starts silent with a delay proportional to harmonic number, slowly ramps UP to its peak over 0.4–5 s, then settles to a ~50% sustain for the long decay. Higher partials take longer to reach peak — mirroring the string's grazing contact creeping up the curved bridge.
- **Per-partial tremolo** (0.4–0.9 Hz, 15% depth, random phase per partial) on partials 3+ gives the characteristic shimmering "singing" quality. Random phase prevents all partials from wobbling in sync.
- **Sub-fundamental sine** at `freq / 2` with a slow attack provides subtle body warmth.
- **Body lowpass** at 6.5 kHz rolls off any harshness without dulling the sweet band.

**Steady-state loop rendering (`startTanpura`):**
- Because each pluck decays for ~9 s but a cycle may be only ~4 s long, naïvely looping one cycle's worth of plucks produces a clicky boundary. Instead:
  1. Render WARM_CYCLES of plucks (computed so at least 10 s of history precedes the snapshot) plus one snapshot cycle plus a short crossfade window.
  2. Slice out the last cycle plus ~180 ms of the following cycle's opening.
  3. Equal-power crossfade (`buildCrossfadedLoop`) the head of the slice with the tail window.
  4. Normalise to 0.9 peak (`normaliseBuffer`) to avoid int16 clipping.
- The resulting WAV plays through a hidden `<audio>` element with `loop = true`. The native media pipeline handles looping at full speed, so playback continues when iOS backgrounds the tab or locks the phone.

**Key functions:**
- `pluckTanpuraString(ctx, dest, freq, jawari, volume, startTime?)` — Creates one string pluck with all harmonics and jawari bloom envelopes.
- `pluckTanpuraStringAt()` — Thin wrapper emphasising explicit-time usage from the offline renderer.
- `getTanpuraStringFreqs()` — Computes string frequencies from tuning, key, and pitch register.
- `startTanpura()` — Renders the steady-state cycle, crossfades the loop boundary, encodes to WAV, and plays through an `<audio>` element with `loop = true`.
- `stopTanpura()` — Pauses the `<audio>` element, revokes the blob URL, and clears the Media Session if no palta is also running.

#### 7. MIDI Keyboard
Uses `navigator.requestMIDIAccess()` to connect to external keyboards. Each note-on creates synth oscillators wrapped in a per-note `masterGain` node. On note-off, the masterGain is faded to zero (simulating a damper). The Map `midiActiveNotes` tracks all sounding notes for cleanup.

#### Event Listeners
- **Preset buttons** (common patterns) — Set input text, hide the nearest-note checkbox, and call `doGenerate()`.
- **Special preset buttons** — Hide the nearest-note checkbox and call `doGenerateSpecial()` with the pattern type.
- **Sequence input (`input` event)** — Show the nearest-note checkbox, update the suggested line count via `updateSuggestedLines()`.
- **Nearest-note checkbox (`change`)** — Re-runs `updateSuggestedLines()` so line count reflects the new parse mode.
- **Lines stepper (−/+)** — Decrement/increment the lines input within [1, 20].
- **Tanpura** — Start/stop toggle, auto-restarts on tuning/pitch change. Volume/tempo/jawari sliders update live.
- **Swara Selector piano** — `updatePianoSwaraLabels()` places swara labels on correct chromatic keys based on Sa=. Click handler toggles variants, re-renders preset labels, re-renders the sequence input text (display name only, no nearest-octave), and re-renders the palta if one is displayed.
- **Key selector** (Sa=) — Updates piano swara labels and re-renders if a palta is displayed.
- **Include Avarohi** — Live toggle that re-generates the palta to show/hide descending section.
- **Sound/instrument options** — Show/hide piano-only and harmonium-only controls.

## Swara Numbering System

Each swara maps to a unique integer for easy transposition via addition:

| Octave | Sa | Re | Ga | Ma | Pa | Dha | Ni |
|--------|----|----|----|----|----|----|-----|
| Lower (mandra)  | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  |
| Middle (madhya)  | 7  | 8  | 9  | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 |
| Upper (taar)     | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 20 |

Transposing a pattern up by one swara = adding 1 to every note value.

## Swara Variant System

Five of the seven swaras have Komal (flat) or Teevra (sharp) variants:

| Swara | Shuddh (semitones) | Variant (semitones) | Type |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|------|
| Sa | 0 | — | Fixed |
| Re | 2 | 1 | Komal |
| Ga | 4 | 3 | Komal |
| Ma | 5 | 6 | Teevra |
| Pa | 7 | — | Fixed |
| Dha | 9 | 8 | Komal |
| Ni | 11 | 10 | Komal |

The Swara Selector piano UI is a chromatic 12-key layout:
- **White keys (7):** Fixed Western notes C, D, E, F, G, A, B
- **Black keys (5):** Fixed Western notes C#, D#, F#, G#, A#
- Swara labels are placed dynamically based on Sa = key selection
- Selecting a variant updates `SWARA_SEMITONES[idx]` which is read by `noteNumToFreq()` for both palta playback and MIDI keyboard

## Frequency Mapping

Swaras use the major scale (shuddh swaras):
- Sa=unison, Re=+2, Ga=+4, Ma=+5, Pa=+7, Dha=+9, Ni=+11 semitones
- Base frequency is set by the key selector (Sa=C → 261.63 Hz, Sa=A → 440 Hz, etc.)
- Formula: `freq = baseFreq * 2^(semitones/12)`
- When Komal/Teevra variants are selected, `SWARA_SEMITONES` is updated and the formula uses the new values automatically.

## How to Extend

### Adding a new piano type
1. Create a function `createMyPianoNote(audioCtx, dest, freq, startTime, duration)` following the pattern of `createGrandPianoNote`.
2. Add it to the `createPianoNote` dispatcher (the `if/else` chain checking `pianoType`).
3. Add a `<option>` to both the palta sound select (`#piano-type-select`) and the MIDI sound select (`#midi-piano-type-select`).

### Adding a new harmonium reed configuration
1. Add a new `else if (reedType === 'your-type')` block inside `createHarmoniumNote`, pushing reeds with the desired `{ freq, amp, detune }` values.
2. Add a `<option>` to both reed selects (`#reed-select` and `#midi-reed-select`).

### Adding a new harmonium brand preset
1. Add a new entry to `HARMONIUM_BRANDS` with a `name`, a list of biquad `filters` (`peaking` / `lowshelf` / `highshelf` / `lowpass` with `freq`, `Q`, and `gain` in dB), and a `reedTrim` (output trim in dB).
2. Add a `<option>` to both brand selects (`#brand-select` and `#midi-brand-select`).
3. Tuning tips: 5 peaking filters are plenty; aim for 2–4 kHz for "projection," 800 Hz–1.6 kHz for the "bark," and a `highshelf` cut above 4–5 kHz to control brightness. The chain applies to every note, so test with both single notes and sustained chords.

### Tuning the harmonium room reverb
The synthetic impulse response lives in `getHarmoniumRoomIR()` (tail length, decay T60, early-reflection times/amplitudes). The dry/wet mix lives in `getHarmoniumReverbBus()` (`dryGain.gain` and `wetGain.gain`). A 82/18 mix is subtle; try 75/25 for more room, 90/10 for drier.

### Adding a new preset pattern
Add a `<button class="preset-btn" data-pattern="Sa Ga Re Ma">Sa Ga Re Ma</button>` inside the appropriate `.preset-chips` div. The event listener is already wired up via `querySelectorAll('.preset-btn:not(.special-preset-btn)')`.

For guruji-prescribed patterns where the traditional practice count differs from what the formula computes, add a `data-lines="N"` attribute to pin the count: `<button class="preset-btn" data-pattern="SRRSRGRS" data-lines="7">Sa Re Re Sa Re Ga Re Sa</button>`. The user can still add/remove lines afterwards with the +/- buttons.

### Adding a new special pattern type
1. Add a new `if (type === 'your-type')` branch inside `generateSpecialPalta()` for the new type.
2. Add a `<button class="preset-btn special-preset-btn" data-special="your-type">Label</button>` in the special patterns `.preset-chips` div.
3. The click handler is already wired via `querySelectorAll('.special-preset-btn')`.
4. Add a label entry in the `labels` object inside `doGenerateSpecial()`.
5. If the pattern has no avarohi, add a check in `doGenerateSpecial()` to hide `#avarohi-option` (see `sa-expand` for reference).

### Adding a completely new instrument
1. Create a synth function: `createMyInstrumentNote(audioCtx, dest, freq, startTime, duration, ...params)` that returns an array of started oscillators/nodes.
2. Add the instrument to the sound select dropdowns.
3. Update `scheduleSegment()` in the playback engine to call your function.
4. Update `playMidiNote()` in the MIDI section to call your function.
5. Add any instrument-specific UI options with appropriate show/hide CSS classes.

### Adding a new swara variant
The current system supports Shuddh + one variant per swara. To add more variants (e.g., both Komal and Ati-Komal):
1. Extend `SWARA_VARIANTS[]` entries to include additional variant semitone values.
2. Update the piano click handler to cycle through variants or use a different selection mechanism.
3. Update `updateSwaraDisplayName()` with display names for the new variants.
4. Update `PIANO_SWARA_LABELS[]` with labels for the new variants.

### Modifying sustain behavior (MIDI)
Piano sustain duration is calculated in `playMidiNote()`:
```javascript
const pianoDur = Math.max(0.6, 3.6 * Math.pow(0.98, adjustedNote - 21));
```
- `3.6` controls the bass sustain time (~3.2s at MIDI note 21)
- `0.98` controls how fast sustain decreases with pitch
- `0.6` is the minimum sustain for the highest notes

Damper release time:
```javascript
const pianoReleaseTime = Math.max(0.05, 0.2 - adjustedNote * 0.0013);
```

## Browser Requirements

- **Web Audio API** — all modern browsers
- **Web MIDI API** — Chrome, Edge, Opera (not supported in Firefox/Safari without flags)
- **Google Fonts** — Poppins font loaded from CDN (falls back to system sans-serif)

## Running Locally

No build step required. Just open `index.html` in a browser:

```bash
open index.html
# or
python -m http.server 8000   # then visit http://localhost:8000
```

For MIDI keyboard support, you must serve over HTTPS or localhost (Web MIDI API security requirement).
